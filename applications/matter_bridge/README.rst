This Matter bridge application demonstrates the usage of the :ref:`Matter <ug_matter>` application layer to build a bridge device.
The bridge device allows the use of non-Matter devices in a :ref:`Matter fabric <ug_matter_network_topologies_structure>` by exposing them as Matter endpoints.
The devices on the non-Matter side of the Matter bridge are called *bridged devices*.

See the subpages for how to use the application and how to extend it.
